In order to improve the competitiveness of this region. The analysis is the SWOT analysis, R/C ratio, and the Analytical Hierarcy Process (AHP). The data is using primary data from the respondents that the sample consists of academics, businessmen, Government, and community leaders. These results showed that: 1). the majority of SMEs cluster supporting its business profitable tourism of Borobudur. 2). power factor in favor of the tourist attraction is strategically located in the tourist area of the world Temple namely Borobudur, but less weak-side supported the production of the good local souvenirs. Tourism development opportunities and challenges is Asean free market, and over the function of land nature tourism. (3) the tourism cluster development strategy Priorities are (a) supporting production develops tourism, (b) improve marketing, (c) improve the supporting infrastructure, (d) strengthening the institutional, and (e) improving the managerial quality. © 2017.

One of the disadvantages gives negative impacts, such as traffic jam, which directly decreases a highway performance as well as increases air and noise pollution. A suitable policy has not been formulated to overcome the traffic jam in most highways in big cities. However, traffic demand management regard to noise pollution is required in most cities of developing countries, particularly Surabaya City, as a case study area. This study aims to understand the influence of saturated flow of highway on noise pollution for several types of road corridors. The results reveal that saturated flow of highway has a significant effect on noise pollution. By examining the alternatives of space-transport development strategies, the intention is to reduce noise pollution together with decreasing traffic jam due to decreasing the number of light vehicles. This research proposes the improvement of public transport (PT) by planning a Mass Rapid Transit ((MRT). In addition, a structure of compact zones is designed as urban spatial strategy alternatives. Its substantially reduction is achieved with the design of improvement of PT systems and compact zone. The best option for reducing noise pollution level, the implementation of an integrated space-transport development strategy, is then recommended. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",2261236X,,,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040526049

This condition increases the pressure on the existing urban road infrastructure and requires substantial maintenance and often expansion of the inter/rural-urban as well as local road as mobility of people and goods upsurge extensively. The construction of these new network and maintenance of existing road infrastructures consumes huge natural resources which further might increase volume of waste and greenhouse gas emission. Currently, approximately 28% provincial road and 41% local (urban) road network in Indonesia are in unsatisfactory condition. There is obvious demand to improve regional road with minimum ecological impact despite limited amount of resources and budget. In achieving sustainable road network, local authorities require a strategy in tackling this complex, large-scale and interconnected problems. This study aims to formulate relevant strategy for local authorities - urban or inter rural-urban level within a province - in operation, maintenance and development of road network by applying strategic management principles. Rational decision model was used in strategy formulation in three consecutive steps: input stage, Matching stage, and Decision Stage. Rational decision model was also used in strategy establishment taking into account the Environmental Minister regulation and some important issues in the Department of public works employing sustainability concept. The strategy proposed is believed to be ecologically sound (environmentally friendly) while improving local road network quality. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",2261236X,,,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040525525

Among the five principle building structures, namely the nuclear island, turbine building, annex building, diesel generator building and radwaste building, the safety of the nuclear island building is the most concerned. This paper investigates the dynamic response of the nuclear island building of the AP1000 plant subjected to safe shutdown earthquake loadings. A finite element model for the building, which is assumed to be built in a hard-rock base, is developed and its dynamic response is computed with the aid of the commercial finite element package ANSYS. The dynamic characteristics, including the natural frequencies, the vibration modes, and the time histories for displacements, velocities, and accelerations of the building are obtained for two typical safe shutdown earthquakes, El Centro and Kobe earthquakes. The dynamic behavior of the building due to the earthquakes and its safety is examined and highlighted. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",2261236X,,,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040523737
